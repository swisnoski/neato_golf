Writeup (Due 11/11 at 7PM)Permalink

In your code package create a README.md file to hold your project writeup. Your writeup should touch on the following topics. We expect this writeup to be done in such a way that you are proud to include it as part of your professional portfolio. As such, please make sure to write the report so that it is understandable to an external audience. Make sure to add pictures to your report, links to Youtube videos, embedded animated Gifs (these can be recorded with the tool peek).

    What was the goal of your project? Since everyone is doing a different project, you will have to spend some time setting this context.
    How did you solve the problem (i.e., what methods / algorithms did you use and how do they work)? As above, since not everyone will be familiar with the algorithms you have chosen, you will need to spend some time explaining what you did and how everything works.
    Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
    What if any challenges did you face along the way?
    What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
    Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
